# Agile Methodology
Agile software development refers to a group of software development methodologies based on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams.

**MY SPRINTS**
 
 1. **Minimum Criterion**
		 
    To add Video Call feature:
	1. Explored different Web technologies that can be used.
	2. Decided to go with WebRTC P2P connection due to extensive documentation and ease of usage.
	3. Researched about pre-existing solutions so as to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
	4. Found out that PeerJS implements and wraps WebRTC and more in a very simple interface.
	5. Went through its documentation and started implementing it.<br><br>
	

 2.  **Added multiple people in a single call feature**
       1. This feature was a breeze with PeerJS. I just had to do a few tweaks in Server side code and automatic Grid adjustments in UI.
       2. Also created the Profile Page to give choice of creating a New Room or Joining an existing one.<br><br>
		
**Completed these 2 in 1st week.**<br>

**For the next week I completed the following features**


3. **Worked on its UI**<br>
		Worked on its FrontEnd and Video Grid to make it visually appealing and usable by anyone. <br><br>
4. **Deployed it on Heroku**<br>
		***Should be extended*** <br>
		Deployed it on Heroku and tested it for connection on different network.
		Made a CI pipeline for automatic deployments to Heroku directly from GitHub.<br>
		For more info, check Developer's section at the end of this ReadMe.
		<br><br>
5. **Added  Video & Mic toggles, Share screen and End call buttons.**<br><br>


**For 3rd week**<br>

6. **Added Screen Share feature**  <br>
		1. Added Screen Share feature using PeerJS and WebRTC APIs (`navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia`).<br>
		2. This also gave me the idea to add enlarge one video tile feature.<br><br>

7. **Added authentication using firebase.** <br>
		1. Added native Login with Email ID & Password.<br>
		2. Used OAuth2.0 with Firebase to add login with Google, GitHub and Microsoft (Azure AD).<br>
		3. Designed and implemented Frontend for this view.<br><br>
	

**Started working on chat feature**
**In the 4th week**

8.  By the time  the ***adapt feature*** came I had almost completed my chat feature for meeting room. After that I added it to before and after meet, and worked on its UI.
9. In the end I added the **Podcast** feature. 

In between this process I always used to commit my changes in my repository to keep the track of previous work and test it side by side.

Therefore, by proper planning I was able to complete my project in a month.


## Developer's Guide
### For local development:
 1. Clone the repository on your machine.
 2. Install all the libraries used for it by running `npm install`.
 3. Start the server by `npm run startt`.
 4. In another terminal run peer server by  `npm run peer`.
 5. The app should be now listening on port 3000 and PeerJS on port 443. You can see the app by opening http://localhost:3000/ on your browser.


### To deploy on Heroku: 
 1. Create a new app.
 2. Push the code using Heroku CLI or connect the Heroku app to the GitHub repository containing this code (make a CI Pipeline).
 3. To enable WebSockets on Heroku, you need to enable http session affinity via  `heroku features:enable http-session-affinity -a {app-name}`
 4. Your WebApp must be up & running now.

 
### To set up Firebase authentication:

1. Login to https://firebase.google.com/ and go to console.
2. Create a Web App over there and go to Authentication.
3. Under Sign-in method enable different methods of authentication.
4. To get your Firebase config file go to `project settings -> general settings -> add your web app -> get the config file`. 

	**For OAuth2.0**

 	Get your Client ID and Secret from different platforms.
 
 	For Microsoft:
 	1. Go to "Azure Portal" and log in.
 	2. Search for Azure Active Directory and create an app.
 	3. Go to authentication -> add the redirect URL provided in Firebase and copy over the client ID and secret to Firebase console. 
	 
	 <br>

	For GitHub:

 	1. Go to `GitHub settings -> Developer's Settings -> OAuth apps`.
	2. Create a new app and get your client ID and secret.
